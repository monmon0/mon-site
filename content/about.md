title: Get to Know Me
---

My **goal** is to become a **polymath** and approaching problems from a **multi-disciplinary** perspective. (like...like Da Vinci ꒰꒪꒫꒪⌯꒱♡✧)

### Tech
- I onced joined a Hackathon, got 1st but the prize was taken away since my idea was "brilliant" but the code was not 
- I never knew Github Desktop existed until my teacher pointed it out since my laptop couldn't download it and I have thought manually committing (still do btw) was the only way 
- My first introduction to Computer Science was actually through plain HTML in grade 6 and I thought Marquee (urgh I know) was the coolest thing ever

### Art
- I now mainly do freelance commissions and <a href="https://foundation.app/monmon_06">1/1 NFT art </a>
- I won 10k USD (1st) from an <a href="https://twitter.com/monmonn_06/status/1517764110728978433?s=20&t=6zZYHXakg7JZhodS8HcqCg">art competition</a> with 500+ entries on Twitter
- I placed 4th on <a href="https://www.clipstudio.net/en/cspcontest29/">Clip Studio Paint 29th Contest</a> but I actually joined just for the subscription
- I grow an art account from 0 to 36k+ followers in 6 months on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chinchin_art/">Instagram</a>
- I maintain an art <a href="https://discord.gg/NJHmwyYRJj">Discord server </a> with 150+ members

### Miscellaneous

- My favourite book is "The Picture of Dorian Gray" by Oscar Wilde 
- I taught myself AP Calculus BC before taking any Calculus class
- I get really hyper fixated on a hobby, a list of them include lego brick building, wooden model building, Ripstick riding, needle felting, collecting books and figures, and of course, art and coding.
- I love love love x3 planning, I love organize my daily schedule and plan ahead for everything
- I love getting into heated debate, a little too much for my own good
- I work in my family VR arcade from 3-10pm everyday (even on weekends) so that makes me exceptionally skilled at Beat Saber (like **actually**)
- I can recite quotes from The Big Bang Theory
