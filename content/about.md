title: Get to Know Me ✩°｡ ⋆⸜ 🎧✮
---

I always have been fascinated by **polymaths** (like Da Vinci ꒰꒪꒫꒪⌯꒱♡✧). As a young obnoxious 18 y.o, I wanted to make my mark on earth but meanwhile, just live to the fullest is good enough. 

### 💻 Tech ˚ʚ♡ɞ˚
- I'm currently looking into getting into Data Science. I have fallen in love with Stat despite it being my hardest UG course so far ⋆𐙚₊˚⊹♡.
- I'm currently looking for internship. Breaking through the door is hard ;-; Wish I know how to network more but I believe that the harder you work, the easier life gets.
- I have quite good experience with UI/UX and web dev, but this year I want to develop my functional programming skills more. </br>
</br>
P/S: (if you interested in my <a href="/projects"> Past Projects <a> or <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAFuY5Zxt4c/a9M3j87-FPWvlWYZ22tyiw/view?utm_content=DAFuY5Zxt4c&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=viewer" target="_blank"> **Resume** <a>, please do take a look :3)
- I plan to spend my summer reading this <a href="https://www.statlearning.com/"> textbook </a> and Kaggle a little bit!
- I'm also working with a secret project with one of my good girlfriend! Go WOMEN in STEM!!

### 🎨 Art ૮ ․ ․ ྀིა
- I wished I find the time to draw more now...Maybe I can get back to it when life gets more managable! In the meanwhile, check out <a href="https://itxmonmon.art/"> my character? </a>
- I won 10k USD (1st) from an <a href="https://twitter.com/monmonn_06/status/1517764110728978433?s=20&t=6zZYHXakg7JZhodS8HcqCg">art competition</a> with 500+ entries on Twitter
- I placed 4th on <a href="https://www.clipstudio.net/en/cspcontest29/">Clip Studio Paint 29th Contest</a> but I actually joined just for the subscription
- I grow an art account from 0 to 38k+ followers in 6 months on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/monmon_artz/">Instagram</a>, still my best brag but to be honest, I was really lucky with reels. Unfortunaly, the numbers must decline due to inactivity by now.
- I got an offer to teach on Class101 but I think I'm really lacking on fundamentals. I would not even pay for my own class.

### 💡 Miscellaneous

- My favourite book is "The Picture of Dorian Gray" by Oscar Wilde.
- I get really hyper fixated on a hobby, a list of them include lego brick building, wooden model building, needle felting, collecting books and figures, badminton (only when my friends dragged me out) and of course, art and coding.
- I love getting into heated debate, a little too much for my own good.
- I used to work in my family's VR arcade that makes me exceptionally skilled at Beat Saber (like **actually**).
- I can recite quotes from The Big Bang Theory

### 🌏 Curent Life Vision
- Single pet owner travelling and living all over Asia (I really miss the people and the food).
- Find something I can devote my adult years too since if I don't want a family, I need to employed myself elsewhere.
- Commission the art god <a href="https://twitter.com/rei_17" target ="_blank"> Rei </a>
