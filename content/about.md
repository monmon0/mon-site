**I believe** is a minimalistic Hugo blogging theme. The theme is inspired from [Poole](https://getpoole.com) and [Listed](https://github.com/ronv/listed)

### Tech
- I onced joined a Hackathon, got 1st but the prize was taken away since my idea was "brilliant" but the code was not 
- I never knew Github Desktop existed until my teacher pointed it out since my laptop couldn't download it and I have thought manually committing was the only way
- My first introduction to Computer Science was actually through plain HTML in grade 6 and I thought Marquee (urgh I know) was the coolest thing ever

### Art
- I now mainly do freelance commissions and <a href="">1/1 NFT art </a>
- I won 10k USD (1st) from an <a href="">art competition</a> with 500+ entries on Twitter
- I placed 4th on <a href="">Clip Studio Paint 29th Contest</a> but I actually joined just for the subscription
- I grow an art account from 0 to 36k+ followers in 6 months on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chinchin_art/">Instagram</a>
- I maintain an art <a href="https://discord.gg/NJHmwyYRJj">Discord server </a> with 150+ members

### Miscellaneous

- My favourite book is "The Picture of Dorian Gray" by Oscar Wilde 
- I love getting into heated debate, a little too much for my own good
- I got really hyper fixated on a hobby, a list of them include lego brick building, wooden model building, Ripstick riding, needle felting, collecting rare covers of books, and of course, art and coding.
- I failed multiple art accounts before actually growing the one that got a big following and get me commissions >:)
- I can recite quotes from The Big Bang Theory
