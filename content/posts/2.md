(ROUGH COPY (1/?) I recently came across this<a href=”https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdhEpBRnOwiFI-ieNKKu3Y0KcoFbd_ZWod1LeyoV6EEfY78HA/viewform”>  Google survey </a> that tests survey taker ability to differentiate between AI generated art and actual illustrated art by artists. The results ( this data is taken from my mutuals on Twitter and the sample size is not large enough to be taken seriously) suggest that an average (be it an artist or enjoyer) person can have a 50% chance of getting it right on the first try. Some of the most prominent factors that help the differentiating process seem to be the hands, anatomy, and the unflattering flat shading (more on this). This is incredibly fascinating since the popular sentiment seems to be anti-AI art amongst artists across popular platforms like Twitter or Instagram. The claims appear to be the artists are not giving their consent for the art to be used in model training. This leads to fear of art theft (an interesting case has happened on <a href="https://twitter.com/GenelJumalon/status/1580401094454222848?s=20&t=SnHfegipHc8zVEbY6lqXTA"> Twitter </a>) and ethical issues like rendering creative jobs obsolete. Even ludicrous claim like AI is dissecting parts of popular artists' artwork and Frankenstein’ed the art into a complete one has appeared to be an infamous argument. 

So an ethical dilmena (as any true-to-name potentially disruptive invention has) is posed: <b>Where's the line need to be drawn so tech and art can harmoniously sing the chorus of invention? </b>
