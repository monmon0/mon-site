One phrase I often hear over and over and over again is, “Art reflects reality”. Though it does sound irrefutable to a certain extent, a far more accurate claim, I’d often vainly argue, is “Art reflects its creator”, not reality itself. Reality is a mirror; you stand on one side of the glass thinking what it reflected to be the only truth, but how can you be so sure that there’s no one on the other side banging on the glass screaming you are only fooling yourself? What most people would often perceive to be the “reality of the world” is just the world itself bend and carefully curated to fit into their paradigm. In short, what reality really reflected, it’s just yourself. Your beliefs, strengths, and shortcomings: vivid and confronting.

One of my favorite lines that I’ve ever read, and I will have to apologize beforehand for the excessive reference to Oscar Wilde, is, “The reason I will not exhibit this picture is that I am afraid that I have shown in it the secret of my own soul”. (The Picture of Dorian Gray, O.W).

Here, the brilliant artist who said this line is refusing to display his most mastered work for only one exact reason, the painting is too revealing. Of his nature, soul and everything that he ever thought of himself as, is and will be. For exactly that reason, I’d argue that even the most humble artist, would acknowledge that somewhat of their creation is, if not entirely, centered around themselves. We, artists (or as I often claimed, art-doer) pretentiously appear to be detached from our art, as if they are separate entities from ourselves. But the truth is, no good art is ever produced without the artist staking themselves on the canvas with a marginally small bet that the world will not turn away with disgust from them. 

Every (good) art piece is just a platter of the artist served raw.

For so, …

Art is pretentious because it absorbs the artist too fully. Artists often claimed far greater astronomical weights to the meaning of their art. But turns out, they are just scared that someday someone will truly see it, that their art is just themselves encoded in colors: predictable like binary, divulge like atoms and as easily lost as a needle in a thunderous forest. 

But that does not diminish the riveting foundation of art throughout mankind's development, maybe it’s so appreciated for exactly that reason.

Again, reality is a mirror. Viewers see the art, or the artist, in themselves. That’s why themes such as archetypes or religion, as outdated as they can be, are not lost but only enhanced through the gripping hand of time.

To end this article, here’s another Oscar Wilde quote you can put in your pocket to sound pretentious about yourself,
"Art is the most intense mode of individualism that the world has known."

Or you know, to remember this article by. Either works.
