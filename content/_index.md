## Welcome to my page! üëã

Hey, I'm Monica - a tech enthusiast, coder and art-doer. I grew up in the heart of Vietnam and now curently finishing high school in Canada.

I've always thought I will work in a creative field since I have achieved many things in my art journey, but an introductory course in 2020 using Python has forever changed my career trajectory. I love endowing myself in new possibilities and easily obsessed over anything I find remotely interesting. 

Ever since the 2nd semester of grade 9, I work everyday after school in my family VR arcade. So for the little extra time-frame I have, I spent coding, learning maths and doing art freelance works. I have an inexplicable appreciation for aesthetics, whether it is a exquisite artwork or an elegantly written piece of code; they fascinate me unboundedly.
